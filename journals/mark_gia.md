The project has come along well this week.
we designed the wire-frame.
we designed the proposed UX/UI.
we hashed out baseline models and api structure.
we sorted hierarchy for structuring data points.
we worked as a group, everyone contriubted and taught/learned things.
we have head and tail standups every day.
overall, we are coming along.

we got everything working, with big help from my teammates my code was turned functional
I had a wonderful experience with my team, wish I could have contributed more beyond the design phase
I doubt I would have completed without them.
overall I think we executed our game plan wonderfully.
we had a design, we found out the most efficient way to implement it, made some changes and accomplished what we set out to do
