The project has come along well this week.
we designed the wire-frame.
we designed the proposed UX/UI.
we hashed out baseline models and api structure.
we sorted hierarchy for structuring data points.
we worked as a group, everyone contriubted and taught/learned things.
we have head and tail standups every day.
overall, we are coming along.
